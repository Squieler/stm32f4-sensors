# NMEA Sentence Parsing Examples for STM32F4
There are two examples for NMEA sentence parsing from any GPS device supporting. For these two libraries, Ublox-NEO6M is used.

* "GPS NEO-6M" is based on the YouTube video: https://youtu.be/vn5J5C_NpI4
* "NEO6M - LwGPS - STM32 Example" is an example of implementation of LwGPS library, which is preferred in my later projects. (Recommended method.)
